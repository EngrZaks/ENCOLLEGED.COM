            <p>Dark mode (or Night mode) gives a more pleasant reading experience, is cool on the eyes especially at night, it helps save battery on smartphones equipped with O-led displays and it just simply makes things look more gorgeous (OMG! have you seen Instagram dark mode? What of Shazam’s?). It’s no wonder it has been a trend for a while now and apps like twitter and Instagram where quick to adopt it and a lot of other apps have gradually adopted it over time.  </p>
            <p>If you have android 10, with its built-in dark mode support, you can treat yourself to a homogenously dark experience especially at night which is pleasing to the eyes, beautiful on the display, soft on the battery and with reduced glare. I am personally a fan of dark mode and have dark mode enabled on almost all my apps across all my devices (Microsoft’s windows has dark mode enabled since version 1909 that was released in the 2nd quarter of 2019).</p>
            <p>Although Facebook has pushed night mode to some of its applications (Instagram & Facebook messenger), the users of WhatsApp (1.5 billion active) has endured a very long wait and before the wait “officially” gets over, let’s get it over already.</p>
